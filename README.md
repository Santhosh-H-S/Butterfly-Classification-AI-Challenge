# Butterfly Classification AI Challenge
## The aim of this challenge is to classify given images into 50 categories of butterflies.

The dataset contains images of 50 species of butterflies from around the world. It contains two directories "TRAIN" and "TEST" with 4479 and 500 images respectively. The training images are provided in the directory of the specific class itself. The names of the directories are "class labels" to be used for submission. The aim is to classify the "TEST" images into one of the 50 classes.
